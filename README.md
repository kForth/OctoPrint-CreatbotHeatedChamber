# CreatBot Util

This plugin add various utility functions to make OctoPrint work better with CreatBot printers.

## Features

- Send "Start/Stop Serial Print" commands whenever a print is started, cancelled, or finished (M6006 & M6007).

- Replace the Marlin 'Set Chamber Temperature' command (M141) with the CreatBot command (M6013).

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html).

Open OctoPrint Settings (wrench icon) -> Plugin Manager -> Get More -> Paste the url from below in the "... from URL" field.

Retart the instance after installing.

## Notes

This plugin should work for most/all CreatBot 3D Printers but has only been tested with a CreatBot F430.

Your CreatBot firmware may need to be upgraded to at least v5.6, the original v5.5 firmware that shipped with my CreatBot F430 did not support the Heated Chamber (M6013) command.
