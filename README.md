## Notes

This plugin should work for most/all CreatBot 3D Printers but has only been tested with a CreatBot F430.

You may need to upgrade your printer's firmware to take full advantage of this plugin's features.
The original v5.5 firmware that shipped with my CreatBot F430 did not support the Heated Chamber (M6013) command, an upgrade to v5.6 was required.
